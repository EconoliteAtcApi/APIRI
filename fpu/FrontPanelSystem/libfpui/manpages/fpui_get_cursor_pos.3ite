.SH "NAME"
\fBfpui_get_cursor_pos\fR \- Get the current Cursor Position
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf 
.B #include <fpui.h>

.sp
\fBint fpui_get_cursor_pos( int\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBint *\fR \fIrow\fR, \fBint *\fR \fIcolumn\fR \fB)\fR
.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_get_cursor_pos\fR(3ite) library call returns the current 
position of the cursor in the \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR arguements.

.br 
Parameters:
.br 
\fIfd\fR	 	is the file descriptor returned by \fBfpui_open\fR(3ite).
.br 
\fIrow\fR		is the reference of an integer storage location.
.br 
\fIcolumn\fR	is the reference of an integer storage location.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the current cursor position is loaded into the
locations referenced by \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR and 0 (zero) is returned.
On error, the \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR variables remain unchanged and \-1 is returned,
with \fIerrno\fR set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
refer to \fBfpui_write_string\fR(3ite) for additional errors.
.SH "NOTE"
This operation actually calls \fBfpui_write_string\fR(3ite) with the
constant string "<ESC>[6n"   
(0x1b 0x5b 0x36 0x60).
.br 
It expects a response of the form "<ESC>[\fIPy\fR;\fIPx\fRR"  
(0x1b 0x5b \fIPy\fR 0x3b \fIPx\fR 0x52)
where \fIPy\fR and \fIPx\fR are the \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR indexes.
