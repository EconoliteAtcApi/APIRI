.SH "NOTE"
There are no checks for duplicate \fIkey\fR values or duplicate escape sequences.
Escape sequences are compared in the order they appear in the list.
New \fIkey\fR mappings are inserted in the first available slot in the list,
which may be a slot vacated by an earlier delete operation. This means
that the list may not be in the order mappings were added.
\fBfpui_del_keymap\fR()
will remove the first occurence of the specified \fIkey\fR from the list. A second,
duplicate entry would require another \fBfpui_del_keymap\fR() operation.

.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_get_keymap\fR(3ite) operation will return, in the arguement \fIstr\fR,
the escape sequence associated with the value of \fIkey\fR. If an entry corresponding
to the value of \fIkey\fR is not found, the first character in the \fIstr\fR array will be \fBNULL\fR.
The arguement \fIstr\fR will be \fBNULL\fR terminated if the size of \fIstr\fR is greater
than the size of the escape sequence plus 1 (for the \fBNULL\fR character). Otherwise the
escape sequence will be packed to the size of the \fIstr\fR array and left unterminated.

.br 
Parameters:
.br 
\fIfd\fR	is the file descriptor returned by \fBfpui_open(3ite)\fR.
.br 
\fIkey\fR	is the single byte code used to locate the keymap entry.
.br 
\fIstr\fR	a character array to return the escape sequence in.
.br 
\fIsize\fR	the size, in characters, of the string array \fIstr\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, 0 (zero) is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, with \fIerrno\fR set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
refer to \fBfpui_write_string(3ite)\fR
.SH "NOTE"
There are no checks for duplicate \fIkey\fR values or escape sequences.
\fIKey\fR values are compared in the order they appear in the list.
New \fIkey\fR mappings are inserted in the first available slot in the list,
which may be a slot vacated by an earlier delete operation. This means
that the list may not be in the order mappings were added.
\fBfpui_get_keymap\fR(3ite)
will return the first occurence of the specified \fIkey\fR from the list. A second,
duplicate entry would not be accessable until the previous entry has been deleted.

\fBint fpui_open( const char *\fR \fIpathname\fR, \fBint\fR \fIflags\fR, \fBconst char *\fR \fIregname\fR \fB)\fR
.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B fpui_open()
library call is used to convert a \fIpathname\fR into a file descriptor
(a small, non\-negative integer for use in subsequent I/O as with
\fBread\fR(2), \fBwrite\fR(2), etc.).
When the call is successful, the file descriptor returned will be
the lowest file descriptor not currently open for the process.
The new file descriptor is set to remain open across exec functions
(see \fBfcntl\fR(2)).
The file offset is unused. 

The parameter
\fIflags\fR
is one of
\fBO_RDONLY\fR, \fBO_WRONLY\fR or \fBO_RDWR\fR
which request opening the file read\-only, write\-only or read/write,
respectively,
.RI bitwise\- or 'd
with zero or more of the following:

In addition to opening the device, the identifier \fIregname\fR is used
to register the terminal with the Front Panel Manager. The name given
in \fIregname\fR will appear in the Front Panel Managers selection screen.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBfpui_open\fR
returns the new file descriptor, or \-1 if an error occurred (in which case,
\fIerrno\fR is set appropriately).

Note that \fBfpui_open\fR can open device special files

.SH "ERRORS"
.TP 
\fBENXIO\fR
\fIpathname\fR
refers to a device special file and no corresponding device exists.

.TP 
\fBENOMEM\fR
Insufficient kernel memory was available.

See \fBopen\fR(2) for additional error codes.

.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_set_auto_scroll\fR(3ite) library call will set auto repeat mode
according to the value of \fIstate\fR.

Auto scroll mode controls the display response when the cursor is
on the bottom most line of the display and a new line is sent. If
auto scroll is \fBTRUE\fR, the display will scroll all lines on the
display up one line, overwriting the top most line. If auto scroll
is \fBFALSE\fR the display remains intact but the cursor will move to
the top most line. In either case the column position of the cursor
is not effected by the new line.

.br 
Parameters:
.br 
\fIfd\fR		is the file descriptor returned by \fBfpui_open\fR(3ite).
.br 
\fIstate\fR	the value to set auto repeat mode to.

.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_set_auto_wrap\fR(3ite) library call will set auto wrap mode
according to the value of \fIstate\fR.

Auto wrap mode controls the displays response when the cursor is
in the right most column and a character is sent. If auto wrap mode
is \fBTRUE\fR the character is displayed at the current cursor position
and the cursor is wrapped back to the beginning of the line. If auto
wrap mode is \fBFALSE\fR the character is displayed at the current cursor
position and the cursor will remain in the right most column. Any
subsequent characters will overwrite the previous ones.

.br 
Parameters:

.TH "fpui_set_keymap" "3ite" "2006-08-02" "Vanteon" "Library Calls"
.SH "NAME"
\fBfpui_set_keymap\fR \- define an escape sequence mapping
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf 
.B #include <fpui.h>

.sp
\fBint fpui_set_keymap( int\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBchar\fR \fIkey\fR, \fBchar *\fR \fIeseq\fR \fB)\fR
.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_set_keymap\fR(3ite) library call is used to add an escape
sequence mapping to the calling processes virtual terminal.
When an escape sequence is received by the virtual terminal,
typically from the keypad, it is compared to the list of key mappings.
If a match is found, the entire escape sequence is replaced with the single \fIkey\fR character and
returned to the caller. Mappings only effect character strings moving
from the front panel hardware to the application in focus.

.br 
Parameters:
.br 
\fIfd\fR		is the file descriptor returned by \fBfpui_open\fR(3ite).
.br 
\fIkey\fR		is the single byte code to be returned when the character sequence is found in the received character string.
.br 
\fIeseg\fR	is the escape sequence to be replaced.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero (0) is returned.  
On error, \-1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
\fBENOMEM\fR	More then 16 mappings are defined.

.SH "NOTE"
There are no checks for duplicate \fIkey\fR values or duplicate escape sequences.
Escape sequences are compared in the order they appear in the list.
New \fIkey\fR mappings are inserted in the first available slot in the list,
which may be a slot vacated by an earlier delete operation. This means
that the list may not be in the order mappings were added.

.fi 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfpui_write_char_at\fR(3ite) library call first moves the cursor
to the location specified by \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR and then
attempts to write a single character \fIch\fR to the device referenced
by \fIfd\fR.

.br 
Parameters:
.br 
\fIfd\fR		is the file descriptor returned by \fBfpui_open\fR(3ite).
.br 
\fIch\fR		the character to be written.
.br 
\fIrow\fR		the cursor row index
.br 
\fIcolumn\fR    the cursor column index.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBfpui_write_char_at\fR(3ite) will return the number of bytes actually
transfered to the device at \fIfd\fR, (in this case, 1) or \-1 if an error
occurred, with \fIerrno\fR set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
refer to \fBwrite\fR(2) for error codes.
.SH "NOTE"
This routine actually wraps a \fBwrite\fR(2) call.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ATC API SRS v02.05, August 11, 2006
.SH "RESTRICTIONS"
\fIRow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR values are truncated to the limits of the physical display.
